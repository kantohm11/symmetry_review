# Quantum Anomaly in 1+1d QFT

In this chapter we learn about quantum anomaly of symmetry in 1+1-dimensional QFT. A QFT is a quantum mechanics equipped with a continuous locality (while a lattice system possess a discrete locality).[^QFTvsLattice] Here, the locality means that we have the notion of "space", and the observables are contained in the space.
This locality (plus some assumption) prohibits the projective phase that we discussed so far, but then there is possibly more subtle anomaly about how much local the composition law of the symmetry is.
It is not a very traditional way but we see this phenomenon through the action of the symmetry on the Hilbert spaces of QFT on *an interval* with different boundary conditions. The quantum anomaly in this dimensions for a finite group $G$ can be captured by the 3rd group cohomology.

[^QFTvsLattice]: Most things in this chapter are supposed to be applied to both of QFTs and lattice systems. It is just that KO is more familiar with QFTs and also the lecture is for high-energy students.


## QFT on a manifold and symmetry
As emphasized, the locality plays the essential role in (topological properties of) QFT.
One concequence of the locality is that,
given a $d+1$-dimensional QFT, we can quantize the theoy on a spacial closed manifold $M_d$ to get $\mathcal{H}_{M_d}$.[^structure]
In other words a QFT is not just the Hilbert space and the Hamiltonian, but a rule to assign them when a closed manifold $M_d$ is given.
It is more precise to express the same thing in terms of the algebra of operators. 
For a QFT, given a region $R \in \mathbb{R}^{d,1}$, there is the algebra of local operators contained in $R$: $\mathcal{A}(R)$.
Then we "glue" the algebra $\mathcal{A}(B^{d+1})$ on a ball to get $\mathcal{A}(R)$ for an arbitrary manifold $R$. In particular we can get $\mathcal{A}(M_d\times \mathbb{R})$.[^rough]

[^rough]: This explanation is awfully rough. For a better discussion the reader might refer to @Witten:2021jzq

A symmetry also is expected to be local: that if there is a symmetry $T$ in a QFT, that means, for arbitrary $\mathcal{M}_d$,
there should exists a symmetry transformation $T_{M_d}$ on $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}_{M_d}$.
This is manifest in the case of continuous symmetry. 
For example, the unitary operator $U_\lambda$ for a $U(1)$ rotation by angle $\lambda$ is, from the Noether's theorem,
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:Noether)
    U_\alpha = e^{\mathrm{i}\lambda \int_{M_d}j^0 \mathrm{d}^dx},
\end{equation}
where $j^\mu$ is the Noether current. 
In other words the locality of the unitary operator is manifest in the integral in the expression.
For a discrete symmetry, the Noether current is not available. 
However, we can define that a symmetry transformation is a automorphism of $\mathcal{A}(R)$:
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:TonAR)
    T \curvearrowright \mathcal{A}(R) \to \mathcal{A}(R),
\end{equation}
and then $T$ also naturally (projectively) acts on $\mathcal{H}_{M_d}$ which is a representation of $\mathcal{A}(R)$.
In a more explict term, if the QFT is written in terms of fundamental fields and symmetry acts on these fields,
the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{M_d}$ is the Fock space constructed from creation/annhilation operators for each modes of the fields on $M_d$,
and the action of a symmetry on the fields naturally defines the action on the annihilation operators, in turn defining the action on $\mathcal{H}_{M_d}$.

For a local symmetry transformation $T$, defined in the above sense, to be the symmetry of the theory, the corresponding unitary has to commute with the Hamiltonian.
We also assume that the Hamiltonian is local:
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:localHam)
    H = \int T_{00} \mathrm{d}^dx,
\end{equation}
where $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the energy-momentum tensor.
For a symmetry in QFT, we demand that $[U,T_{\mu\nu}] = 0$. Otherwise $U$ does not commute with the spacetime symmetry.


[^structure]: We often need an additional structure to $M_d$. For example, if the theory includes fermionic fields, the manifold $M_d$ has to be equipped with the spin structure. In this lecture we do not care about thie subtle but interesting and important subtlety and assume that the theory is *bosonic*, i.e. does not contain fermionic fields. This amounts to assume only the orientation of $M_d$. (To put a QFT on an unoriented manifold, one needs an anti-unitary symmetry which also be ignored in thie lecture.) The references mentioned in \@ref(othernotes) have contents about fermionic theories.

## No projective phase on S^1 
Now specialize to 1+1d QFT, and consider $M_1 = S^1$, which is the only connected closed 1-dimensional manifold.
A reader might have guessed that, as a generalization of what we have learned in the case of QM, the unitary operator realizing the symmetry on $\mathcal{H}_{S^1}$ might have projective phase in there multiplication rule.
This very natural guess, however, is not correct.

For a general QFT, the Hamiltonian depends on the radius $R$ of $S^1$.
When $R$ is very large compared to any scale in the theory, we regard the QFT on $S^1\times \mathbb{R}_\text{time}$ as the infrared-regulation of QFT on $\mathbb{R}^1\times \mathbb{R}_\text{time}$.

Now, if the QFT has single vacuum, the cluster decomposition principle (which is another manifestation of locality) that the symmetry should preserve it. So $S^1$ with large enough $R$ has single vacuum, which contradicts with a nontrivial projective phase.
More generally, if a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken,
there can be multiple vacua in the $R\to \infty$ limit.
However, if there is a domain wall connecting the two vacua , there is a exponentially suppressed 
amplitude between the two state with finite but large $R$.
Therefore, we expect that, without additional mechanism prohibiting domain walls[^one_form], there is a single vacuum on $S^1$ with large but finite $R$. 
As the projective phase is discrete, captured by $H^2(G)$, it has to be constant of $R$. Therefore we do not expect any nontrivial projective phase of $U$ acting on $\mathcal{H}_{S^1}$ for any radius $R$ of $S^1$.

[^one_form]: The mechanism is the "one-form symmetry" [@Komargodski:2020mxz]. An older reference is [@Hellerman:2006zs].

#Discarding the following original version and specialize to the case of $S^1$.
#A reader might have guessed that, as a generalization of what we have learned in the case of QM, the unitary operator realizing the symmetry on $\mathcal{H}_{M_d}$ might have projective phase in there multiplication rule.
#This very natural guess, however, is not correct.
#(This section is a bit abstract, but we will turn to more concrete example soon.)
#
#For a symmetry to be preserved in the theory, we demanded $[U,T_{\mu\nu}] = 0$. This means that the symmetry operator $U$ can commute with a time evolution operator with a small perturbation $\delta g$ of the metric around the flat one, see Figure \@ref(fig:UGeometry) (a), since $T_{\mu\nu}$ couples with $\delta g$.
#A (potentially) stricter requirement is that $U$ commute with time evolution with very bumpy metric: Figure \@ref(fig:UGeometry) (b).
#Or, one might even demand that $U$ commutes with *topology changing* time evolution: Figure \@ref(fig:UGeometry) (c).
#
#The discrepancy among (a),(b) and (c) of Figure \@ref(fig:UGeometry) should be understood as the *mixed anomaly* between the symmetry transformation and the space time symmetry generated by $T_{\mu\nu}$. 
#A nontrivial fact is that there is no such mixed anomaly in 1+1-dimensional unitary bosonic QFT. 
#For this fact, lacking any of the three adjectives gives a counter example, so this is subtle and beyond the scope of this lecture.[^counter]
#Here let us simply assume that the condition (c) in Figure \@ref(fig:UGeometry).
#
#[^counter]: For a unitary QFT, if the manifold $M_d$ is a sphere $S^d$ with the trivial spin structure, then \@ref(fig:UGeometry) generally holds [@Freed:2016rqq;@Yonekura:2018ufj]. For a non-unitary (probability non-preserving) QFT, the ghost number $U(1)$ symmetry of the $bc$ ghost is the counter example.
#
#Then, consider in particular the lower figure of Figure \@ref(fig:UGeometry). Here, a single copy of $S^{d-1}$ evolves into the disjoint union $S^{d-1} \sqcup S^{d-1}$.
#If we let $Z_\text{split}$ denote the evolution operator $\mathcal{S^d} = \mathcal{S^d}\otimes \mathcal{S^d}$, the assumption we have made states
#\begin{equation}
#    (\#eq:UZ)
#    Z_\text{split} U = (U\otimes U) Z_\text{split}.
#\end{equation}
#Now, if we have to elements of the symmetry group $g_1,g_2$ and corresponding unitaries $U_{g_1}, U_{g_2}$, we worry about the
#potential projective phase in the multiplication : $U_{g_1}U_{g_2} = e^{\alpha(g_1,g_2)}U_{g_1g_2}$. However, \@ref(eq:UZ) tells
#\begin{equation*}
#    Z_\text{split} U_{g_1}U_{g_2} = (U_{g_1}U_{g_2}\otimes U_{g_1}U_{g_2}) Z_\text{split}.
#\end{equation*}
#If there were a projective phase, the amount of the phase differs between the left and right hand side. Therefore there is no projective phase of the symmetry operators acting on $\mathcal{H}_{S^d}$. ($Z_\text{split}$ is nonzero if the QFT is unitary.)
---

Then, is there any projective-ness in the symmetry in 2d QFT?
To explicitly see that, we need to think about *manifolds with boundaries*.[^twist]

[^twist]: Instead one can see it from closed manifold with symmetry twist. Actually this is more conventional way. However KO finds that the manifolds with boundary is more "clean" in a sense.


## 1+1-dimensional periodic scalar theory
Rather than explaining the general theory of a QFT on a open manifold, let us jump to a concrete example: 1+1-dimensional (relativistic) massless periodic scalar $\phi$.
The theory should be explained in any good textbooks on string theory, e.g. @PolchinskiVol1. Here we give a lightening review.

### The model
The action of the free massless periodic scalar theory (on the Minkowski flat space) is (in Polchinski's normalization, in particular $\hbar =1$  as usual)
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:SX)
    S = -\frac{1}{4\pi\alpha'}\int_{M_2} \mathrm{d}\tau\mathrm{d}\sigma \,\eta^{ab}\partial_a X \partial_b X.
\end{equation}
The scalar field $X$ is periodic and we set the periodicity to be $2\pi R$: $X \sim X + 2\pi R$. 
The equation of motion is the massless Klein-Gordon one
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:EOMX)
    \partial^2 X = 0.
\end{equation}
The canonical momentum $\Pi(\sigma,\tau)$ is
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:momentum)
    \Pi = \frac{1}{2\pi \alpha'} \partial_\tau X,
\end{equation}
and the Hamiltonian is
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:HamX)
    H = \frac{1}{2\pi\alpha'}\int\, \mathrm{d}\sigma \delta^{ab}\partial_a X \partial_b X.
\end{equation}

### Quantization on $S^1$ and $U(1)^2$ symmetry
Let us quantize the theory on $S^1$, where we set the periodicity of the spacial coordinate $\sigma \sim \sigma + 2\pi$.
We write the general solution to the EOM \@ref(eq:EOMX) as
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:Xexp)
    X^w(\sigma,\tau) = x +  R w \sigma + 2\pi \alpha' p \, \tau + \mathrm{i}\bigl(\frac{\alpha'}{2}\bigr) \sum_{m = -\infty}^{\infty} \frac1m\Bigl(\frac{\alpha_m}{z^m_+}+\frac{\tilde\alpha_m}{z^m_-}\Bigr),
\end{equation}
where $z = \exp(- \mathrm{i}(\tau \pm \sigma))$.
The second term is possible because both $\sigma$ and $X$ is periodic, and the winding number $w$ is quantized (discretized): $w\in \mathbb{Z}$.
When there is such topologically distinct classical solutions to the EOM exists, we build the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_w$ around each solution labeled by $w$, and the take the direct sum $\mathcal{H} = \bigotimes_w \mathcal{H}_w$ as the total Hilbert space.
The canonical commutation relation gives
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:comu)
    [x,p] = \mathrm{i}, \quad [\alpha_m,\alpha_n] = [\tilde{\alpha}_m,\tilde{\alpha}_n] = m \delta_{m,-n},
\end{equation}
and the Hamiltonian is (up to a divergent constant coming from commuting $\alpha$'s)
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:HamXModes)
    H = \frac{\alpha'}{4} \bigl(\frac{n^2}{R^2}+\frac{w^2 R^2}{\alpha'^2}\bigr) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigl(\alpha_{-n}\alpha_n + \tilde{\alpha}_{-n}\tilde{\alpha}_n\bigr),
\end{equation}
where $n = R p$ is the quantized momentum whose eigenvalues takes in $\mathbb{Z}$, as in the case of the particle on $S^1$.
A general eigenstate can be constructed by acting finite number of operators $\alpha_{-i}$ and $\tilde{\alpha}_{-j}$ on a state $\ket{n,w}$:
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:eigen)
    \alpha_{-i_1}^{t_1}\alpha_{-i_2}^{t_s} \cdots 
    \tilde\alpha_{-j_1}^{s_1}\tilde\alpha_{-j_2}^{s_2} \cdots 
    \ket{n,w},
\end{equation}
where $i_a,j_b,t_c,s_d$ are positive integers, and the state $\ket{n,w}$ satisfies
\begin{align}
    \alpha_i \ket{n,w} = \tilde{\alpha}_j \ket{n,w} = 0,
\end{align}
and has the corresponding quantum number $n$ and $w$.

This system famously have to $U(1)$ symmetries, whose charges are $n$ and $w$ respectively. The former is called the momentum $U(1)$, and the latter called the winding $U(1)$.
We write the corresponding unitaries as $U^p_\lambda$ and $U^w_\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the parameter of the symmetry transformation, so that
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:UpwAct)
    U^p_\lambda \ket{n,w} = e^{\mathrm{i}\lambda n }\ket{n,w},\quad
    U^w_\lambda \ket{n,w} = e^{\mathrm{i}\lambda w }\ket{n,w}.
\end{equation}
Also, the momentum $U(1)$ is basically the canonical momentum $p$ to the average coodinate $x = \int X \mathrm{d}\sigma$, it causes the translation in the space of $X$:
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:UpActX)
    (U^p_{\lambda})^\dagger\, f(X(\sigma,\tau)) \, U^p_{\lambda} = 
    f(X(\sigma,\tau) + \lambda R),
\end{equation}
where $f$ is a periodic function.
With this boundary condition, 


### Projective phases on the Hilbert spaces on an interval
Now let us see how the two $U(1)$ symmetries acts on the Hilbert spaces defined on a manifold with boudnaries. In 1d, there is only one (topology type) of a compact manifold with boundaries: the interval $I = [0,2\pi]$.
To define the theory on the interval, we have to pick boundary conditions for each of the boundaries: $\sigma =0$ (left boundary) and $\sigma =2\pi$ (right boundary).
Here we pick the Dirichlet boundary condition $\mathcal{D}(\theta_L,\theta_R)$
defined by 
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:Dirichlet)
    X(\sigma = 0,t) = R \theta_L, \quad X(\sigma = 2\pi, t)= R \theta_R.
\end{equation}
The expansion of the periodic field $X$ in this case is 
\begin{equation}
    (\#eq:XexpDirichlet)
    X = R\theta_L + R w \sigma + \mathrm{i}\bigl(\frac{\alpha'}{2}\bigr) e^{-\mathrm{i}\tau} \sum_{m = -\infty}^{\infty}  \frac1m \alpha_m \sin(m \sigma/2),
\end{equation}
where the winding $w$ now has to takes values in $w \in (\theta_R-\theta_L)/2\pi + \mathbb{Z}$.
We write the Hilbert space of states on the interval with the boundary condition $\mathcal{D}(\theta_L,\theta_R)$ as $\mathcal{H}_{\theta_L,\theta_R}$, and the state with winding $w$ in it as $\ket{w}_{\theta_L,\theta_R}$. We only consider the ground states for the oscillation modes but the story can be applied to the states with these modes without any change.

How does the $U(1)^2$ symmetries acts on the states?
The momentum symmetry translate $X$, and breaks the boundary condition \@ref(eq:Dirichlet). 
But it still defines a linear map *between the Hilbert spaces*:
\begin{align}
    (\#eq:UpactDirichlet)
    U^p_\lambda : \mathcal{H}_{\theta_L,\theta_R} &\to \mathcal{H}_{\theta_L+\lambda,\theta_R+\lambda}\\
    \ket{w}_{\theta_L,\theta_R} &\mapsto \ket{w}_{\theta_L+\lambda,\theta_R+\lambda}.
\end{align}
On the other hand, the winding $U(1)$ symmetry preserved the Dirichlet boundary condition:
\begin{align}
    (\#eq:UwactDirichlet)
    \widetilde{U}^w_\lambda : \mathcal{H}_{\theta_L,\theta_R} &\to \mathcal{H}_{\theta_L,\theta_R}\\
    \ket{w}_{\theta_L,\theta_R} &\mapsto e^{\mathrm{i}\lambda w}\ket{w}_{\theta_L,\theta_R}.
\end{align}
Here we put the tilde on $U^w_\lambda$ because there is one problem with this action, i.e. $\widetilde{U}^w_\lambda = e^{\mathrm{i}(\theta_R-\theta_L)}\widetilde{U}^w_{\lambda+2\pi}$.
